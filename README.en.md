**A Cryptocurrency with Purpose: Where Culture Meets Neurodiversity**

## 🧩 Why "Lukas"? A Name with Cultural Soul
The name **Lukas Coin** carries a powerful cultural coincidence:
- In Chile, **"1 luka" = 1,000 pesos** and **"10 lukas" = 10,000 pesos**.
- For us, **1 LKS = 1,000 smiles** created by improving autistic children's lives.

It’s a nod to everyday life and how small changes (like coins or gestures) can transform realities.
