## What is Lukas Coin?

**Lukas Coin (LKS)** is a non-profit solidarity token created in Chile, combining technology, inclusion, augmentative communication, and autism awareness.

Inspired by Lukas, a Chilean child with autism, this project aims to **break barriers**, **empower communities**, and **connect families** through accessible Web3 tools and transparent blockchain technology.

## Our Vision

- üåé Positively impact thousands of families
- ü§ù Create open-source, free technological tools
- üß† Integrate innovative, accessible and adapted educational systems

## Why "Lukas"?

The name **Lukas Coin** comes from a powerful cultural coincidence:

- In Chile, "1 luka" = 1,000 pesos, "10 lukas" = 10,000 pesos
- For us, **1 LKS = 1,000 smiles** generated by improving the lives of autistic children

It's a tribute to everyday life and how small changes (like coins or gestures) can transform realities.
