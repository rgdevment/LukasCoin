## What is Lukas Coin?

Lukas Coin (LKS) is a non-profit token created in Chile that merges technology, inclusion, augmentative communication, and autism awareness.

Inspired by Lukas, a Chilean child with autism, this project aims to break barriers, empower communities, and connect families through accessible and transparent Web3 tools.

---

## Our Vision

- Positively impact thousands of families.
- Create open and free technological tools.
- Integrate innovative, accessible, and inclusive educational systems.

---

## Why "Lukas"?

In Chile:

1 luka = 1,000 pesos
10 lukas = 10,000 pesos

For us:

1 LKS = 1,000 smiles

It‚Äôs a cultural nod to how small changes (like coins or gestures) can transform lives.
